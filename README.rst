======================
LabVIEW Webcam Library
======================

Don't use this library. Seriously. It's eleven years old. It was a one-off experiment at the time. It's buggy. I don't work on it anymore. I don't even use LabView anymore. 

Wait, what?
===========

People still email me about this library. I'm flattered, but it's really not in their best interest to use it. I'm trying to do the right thing and ward them off.

What can I use instead?
=======================

National Instruments offers a <a href="http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/epd/p/id/5030">free NI-IMAQ driver for USB cameras</a> that works in LabVIEW 7.1 or higher. Please use it.

But I still want your lib!
==========================

OK. The code and last compiled binary are here in GitHub. Do what you will with it. But please don't contact me for help or to complain that it doesn't work.
